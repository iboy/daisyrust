## Learning Objectives ##

1. To introduce, in a practical way, the protocols of symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic systems;
2. To define, in a number of senses, what a *key* is, and how they can be exchanged - in secret;
3. To use and understand a simple substitution (or shift) cipher (Caesar's Cipher);
4. To experience a more complex piece of visual cryptography and consider how it was made;
5. To introduce an overview for how *easy* encryption techniques are made *hard*, with mathematics.

## Cross-curricular applications ##

Mathematics: randomness, factors, prime numbers, modular arithmetic.

## Lesson Summary ##

A practical demonstration of the *key exchange problem*.


## Starter ##

Briefly discuss the main terms and some of the reasons we need secure, private electronic communication channels.

## Main development ##

Demonstrate the key exchange solution in practice.

## Plenary ##

Discuss keys: understand the nature of public and private keys.

Discuss weak encryption: introduce frequency analysis

Work in some 'analogies' of how more complex systems of encryption might work.
Enigma
 

## Extension ##

Consider the mathematical principles in some of the common cryptographic algorithms:
