## Learning Objectives ##

To introduce, in a practical way, the protocols of symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic systems;
To define, in a number of senses, what a *key* is, and how they can be exchanged - in secret;
To use and understand a simple substitution (or shift) cipher (Caesar's Cipher);
To experience a more complex piece of visual cryptography and consider how it was made;
To introduce an overview for how *easy* encryption techniques are made *hard*, with mathematics.

## Cross-curricular applications ##

Mathematics: randomness, factors, prime numbers, modular arithmetic.

## Lesson Summary ##

A practical demonstration of the *key exchange problem*.
