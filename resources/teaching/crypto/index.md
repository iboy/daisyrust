Introducing Cryptography


<aside class="overview do"><h2>Overview</h2></aside>

* Meet Alice, Bob and Eve;
* See an overview of the process of exchanging secret **keys** in public;
* See a simple and more complex cipher algorithm working together;
* See how *visual cryptography* works.
* Learn and discuss some key words and concepts: 
  * cyptography, 
  * encryption, 
  * decryption; 
  * public-keys and key exchange;  
  * ciphers: substitution ciphers
  * digital signatures


<aside class="overview learn"><h2>What students will learn</h2></aside>


1. In a practical way, the protocols of symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic systems;
2. What a *key* is, and how they can be exchanged - in secret;
3. How to use and understand a simple substitution or shift cipher (Caesar's Cipher);
4. How to use a more complex piece of visual cryptography and consider how it was made;
5. A brief overview of how *easy* encryption techniques are made *hard*, with mathematics.
