## What You Will Do ##

This day will be a coding themed day. Students will explore basic concepts of the programming language Swift using Fire Tech Campâ€™s very own interactive playground book: *Swift for Juniors* or Apple's Swift Playground *Fundamentals of Swift*.

You will:

* Do physical actions that help us think about coding and sequences; 
* Solve puzzles and code in a *Swift Playground* exploring sequential instructions, conditional code, control loops and functions
* Journal our progress.
