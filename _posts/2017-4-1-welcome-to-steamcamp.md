This is a demo blog post:

Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `bundle exec jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

We use lots of things to assist our creative play: digital technology, robots, puppets, plants and mushrooms, coding, Lego, Raspberry Pis, electronics, kites, balloons, art-materials, cameras, worms, air, body sensors and much, much more!

We have workshops in Digital Fashion, Retro-gaming, Games programming, AI, Drones, Bio-materials, 3D design and printing, Coding, Sensing, Weather-watching and there are more on the way.
