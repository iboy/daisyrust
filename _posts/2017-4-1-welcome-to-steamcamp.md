<span id="letterS">S</span><span id="letterT">T</span><span id="letterE">E</span><span id="letterA">A</span><span id="letterM">M</span> **CAMP** London is coming soon! 

We offer courses, after-school clubs, holiday activities and parties that bring together <span id="letterS">S</span>cience, <span id="letterT">T</span>echnology, <span id="letterE">E</span>ngineering, <span id="letterA">A</span>rt+Design and <span id="letterM">M</span>aths in exciting creative workshops for all ages.


The workshops encourage **play**, **design** and **making** while exploring deeper connections between ideas involving design, creative computing, material science, games, biology, media, sound and practical maths.

We use lots of things to assist our creative play: digital technology, robots, puppets, plants and mushrooms, coding, Lego, Raspberry Pis, electronics, kites, balloons, art-materials, cameras, worms, air, body sensors and much, much more!

We have workshops in Digital Fashion, Retro-gaming, Games programming, AI, Drones, Bio-materials, 3D design and printing, Coding, Sensing, Weather-watching and there are more on the way.

<span id="letterS">S</span><span id="letterT">T</span><span id="letterE">E</span><span id="letterA">A</span><span id="letterM">M</span> **CAMPs**, **COURSES** and **CLUBs** aim to:

- be open and accessible
- support girls and women in technology
- engage the educationally excluded and
- be fun for all!
