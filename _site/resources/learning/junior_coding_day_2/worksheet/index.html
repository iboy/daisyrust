          <h1>Junior Coding Day 2 - Swift Playgrounds</h1>
          <p>Welcome to our workshop where we will be exploring key concepts in coding using physical games, creative work and Swift Playgrounds.</p>

<h2 id="ice-breaker-20-minutes">Ice breaker (20 minutes)</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Take a selfie and annotate it. Personalise by drawing on it.</li>
  <li>Share it using AirDrop to a class photo album</li>
  <li>Discuss the steps - the procedure and interactions - required to do the task: What did we do? How did it work?</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="introduction-to-swift-and-swift-playgrounds-10-minutes">Introduction to Swift and Swift Playgrounds (10 minutes)</h2>

<p><strong>Introduction to Swift Programming and Swift Playgrounds (5 minutes)</strong></p>

<p><img src="/daisyrust/resources/learning/junior_coding_day_2/images/swiftplayground.jpg" width="480" alt="Swift Playgrounds" /></p>

<p>Playgrounds are environments for learning and testing real Swift code that updates live.
Swift is a new programming language. It started on iOS and macOS and now can power software on Linux and Windows. We will use the Swift Playground  <em>Fundamentals of Swift</em>  to explore the following key concepts in coding:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Commands and Sequences;</li>
  <li>Debugging, Functions and Loops;</li>
  <li>Thinking Efficiently.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s a short video showing the use of  the playground <em>Fundamentals of Swift</em>:</p>

<p><strong>Sharing our work (5 minutes)</strong><br />
We’ll be sharing the material we make using <a href="http://web.seesaw.me">Seesaw</a>. Log in using the iPad app and the picture below (printed in class) .</p>

<p>Then upload your photo created in our ice-breaker and add a reflection (audio, text or video).</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>What do you hope to learn in our session today?</strong></p>

<p>Note your answer to this on SeeSaw</p>

<h2 id="commands-and-sequences-1-hour">Commands and sequences (1 hour)</h2>

<p><strong>Think like a computer: Introduction (5 minutes)</strong></p>

<p>Activity: The class decide on an <em>activity</em> to get you to do. Instead of telling you the activity, they must shout out the step-by-step directions required to <em>perform</em> the action.</p>

<p>Q. How could the instructions be improved?</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Activity: Hide and Seek (20 minutes)</strong></p>

<p>Each person should hide an object for someone to find. Then they video themselves giving <em>verbal</em> instructions to find the object. Share / swop videos and try to find each others objects!</p>

<p>Q. How clear were the instructions? 
Q. What was missing?
Q. How could they be improved?</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Practice (15 minutes)</strong></p>

<p>In Swift Playgrounds complete the following puzzles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Introduction</li>
  <li>Issuing Commands</li>
  <li>Adding a New Command</li>
  <li>Toggling Switches</li>
  <li>Portal Practice</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>Journal your progress in SeeSaw (10 minutes)</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>What is a command?</li>
  <li>What is a sequence?</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>Reflection (10 minutes)</strong></p>

<p>How many moves did it take to solve the puzzle? 
How many commands did you write?
How does it compare with spoken instructions (in the previous task)?
Think of a digital game you play: Names a few commands and sequences that are used?
How does thinking like a person compare with <em>thinking like a computer</em>?</p>

<h2 id="think-like-a-detective-debugging-1-hour">Think like a detective: Debugging (1 hour)</h2>

<p><strong>Introduction (10 minutes)</strong></p>

<p>Define the key terminology: Bugs and Debugging
How do you go about fixing problems?</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Activity: Fixing things (20 minutes)</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Detail the steps that show how to fix something.</li>
  <li>What steps are needed?</li>
  <li>Using ““Explain Everything””, draw and recorded an explanation for each step.</li>
  <li>Share your process with the group.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>Practice: Finding and fixing bugs to the shortest route (15 minutes)</strong></p>

<p>In Swift Playgrounds complete the following puzzles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Finding and Fixing Bugs</li>
  <li>Bug Squash Practice</li>
  <li>The Shortest Route</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>Journal and reflection (15 minutes)</strong></p>

<p>Journal your progress in SeeSaw. Screen-capture when you complete a puzzle.
Upload your notes, images or videos from working with Swift Playgrounds. What did you learn about debugging? What does it mean to ‘think like a detective’?</p>

<p><strong>Reflection</strong></p>

<p>Summarise your experiences around debugging within Swift Playgrounds.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Did the steps in the previous exercise help with the debugging task?</li>
  <li>Did the process for debugging differ from the general process for ‘fixing’? If so, how so?</li>
  <li>Why is bug-squashing important? Does a small bug matter?</li>
  <li>Can you advise a coder how to avoid bugs?</li>
  <li>Debugging takes time: how can we save time when coding?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="thinking-efficiently-functions-and-introducing-loops-1-hour-30-minutes">Thinking efficiently: Functions and introducing loops (1 hour 30 minutes)</h2>
