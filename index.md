<span id="letterS">S</span><span id="letterT">T</span><span id="letterE">E</span><span id="letterA">A</span><span id="letterM">M</span> **CAMP** London is coming soon! 

We offer courses, after-school clubs, holiday activities and parties that bring together:

<span id="letterS">S</span>cience, <span id="letterT">T</span>echnology, <span id="letterE">E</span>ngineering, <span id="letterA">A</span>rt and Design. and <span id="letterM">M</span>aths...

in exciting, creative workshops for all ages.

The workshops encourage **play**, **design** and **making** while exploring deeper connections between ideas involving art, design, creative computing, material science, games, biology, nature, media, sound and practical maths.


We use lots of things to assist our creative play: digital technology, robots, puppets, plants and mushrooms, coding, Lego, Raspberry Pis, electronics, kites, balloons, art-materials, cameras, worms, air, body sensors and much, much more!

We have workshops in Digital Fashion, Retro-gaming, Games programming, AI, Drones, Bio-materials, 3D design and printing, Coding, Sensing, Weather-watching and there are more on the way.

- be open and accessible
- support girls and women in science, computing and technology
- engage the educationally excluded, and
- be fun for all!
