<span id="letterS">S</span><span id="letterT">T</span><span id="letterE">E</span><span id="letterA">A</span><span id="letterM">M</span> education works to integrate creative, critical and artistic perspectives at the heart of Science, Technology. Engineering and Maths (STEM) subjects. By including the 'A' of *Art and Design*, <span id="letterS">S</span><span id="letterT">T</span><span id="letterE">E</span><span id="letterA">A</span><span id="letterM">M</span> approaches value arts methodologies in the exploration of other core subjects. 

However, Art and design processes are not just *tools for learning* or a bolt-on element but are at the root of promoting how we learn to be **innovative**, **creative** and **expressive**. It also seeks to learn through play, exploration and prospective thought *in action*: through *making* and collaborative projects.

>"STEAM isn't about simply 'adding' the arts to the equation or utilising a single element of art (design) in a lesson. It's about looking for naturally-aligned standards between the Arts---all of them---and STEM content areas, and then teaching in and through those standards in a way that allows you to assess both."

## A global movement
<span id="letterS">S</span><span id="letterT">T</span><span id="letterE">E</span><span id="letterA">A</span><span id="letterM">M</span>  in education is a global movement seeking to challenge educational ideas that marginalise creative and expressive subjects favouring STEM subjects that are easier to benchmark and standardise.

## Launching Autumn 2017
We will launch <span id="letterS">S</span><span id="letterT">T</span><span id="letterE">E</span><span id="letterA">A</span><span id="letterM">M</span> **CAMP** with courses in creative computing, games, coding, robotics, sound and music and 3D and animated digital arts. Then we aim to create workshops exploring biology (see our proposed *Craft Mycology* series), digital fashion, astronomy and photography.


Also, <span id="letterS">S</span><span id="letterT">T</span><span id="letterE">E</span><span id="letterA">A</span><span id="letterM">M</span> **CAMPs**, **COURSES** and **CLUBs** aim to:

- be open and accessible
- support girls and women in technology
- engage the educationally excluded and
- be fun for all!
